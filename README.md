2. Open your command prompt (cmd) and navigate to the project directory.

Running the TypeScript File
After installing TypeScript, navigate to the directory containing your TypeScript file (basic.ts) using the command prompt.

Compile the TypeScript file using the TypeScript Compiler (tsc):
tsc basic.ts
This will generate a corresponding JavaScript file (basic.js).

Run the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:

node basic.js
This will execute the JavaScript file and display the output.

Notes
Make sure to replace basic.ts with the actual name of your TypeScript file if it's different.

If you encounter any issues during installation or execution, refer to the official TypeScript documentation for troubleshooting.
